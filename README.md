Jay Champaneri ‚Äî Portfolio (Netflix-style)
Live: https://jayu2236j.github.io/Portfolio-NetFlix/
A simple, fast, static portfolio inspired by Netflix rows. Built with HTML + CSS + vanilla JS.
Cards open detail pages, and content is driven by one data file.

window.CERTIFICATES = [
  {
    id: "google-ai-essentials",
    title: "Google AI Essentials ‚Äî Main Certificate",
    issuer: "Google",
    year: "2025",
    credentialUrl: "https://coursera.org/verify/YOUR-MAIN-ID",

The home page shows each main certificate as a card.
Clicking View details opens certificates.html?id=the-id which lists the sub-certs with links.
